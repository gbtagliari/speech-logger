/// a braindump hands off to organization, a dictation rests at `transcribed` (#41). Serializing costs ~20% over running two at once and

/// coordinator calls it the instant an item lands `queued` and must not block on a
/// transcription), and a lone `drainTask` guarantees exactly one item transcribes
/// at a time regardless of how fast items arrive. Foundation-only with the
/// `mlx_whisper` seam injected, so the whole lane is unit-testable without the binary.
